# Steps for machine learning
# 1. Import the data
# 2. Clean the data
# 3. Split the data into Training Set/Test Set
# 4. Create a model with Training set
# 5. Check the output with test set
# 6. Improve

# Different Tools used for Machine Learning
# 1. NumPy (List and Arrays)
# 2. Pandas (Tabular data)
# 3. scikit-learn (algorithms)
# 4. matlab lib (visualize the data)
# 5. jupyter notebooks (Dev environment)
